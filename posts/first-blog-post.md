In my film, I wanted the bulk of my film to follow the pace of the music. Which I chose a royalty free music from the youtube library called "A Quiet Thought" by Wayne Jones. I chose this song specifically of it's calm mood. By using this song, I would be share this sense of going down a memorie lane with the audience. 

I stilled wanted to add a bit of sounds even if the video is very music heavy. So I created them out of scratch in my intro by making a diegetic sound that indicate my body landing on the table, and a non diegetic sound of a book turning quickly as the intro fades into white. By doing this, I would be able to work on the audio adjustment as I soon found out that the recorded sound was very soft that I had to increase the gain of the audio in the intro.
